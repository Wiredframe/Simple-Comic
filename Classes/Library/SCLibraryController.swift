//
//  SCLibraryController.swift
//  Simple Comic
//
//  The library's actions, and the state the library window observes: adding and scanning
//  folders, fetching a comic's bytes when it is opened, handing it to the existing session
//  machinery, and writing the reading position back when the window closes.
//
//  Opening always goes through a copy inside the app container. That is the point of the
//  design: TSSTManagedGroup then bookmarks an ordinary file we own, so nothing in the
//  reader has to know about the sandbox, the library folder, or a volume that might go
//  away mid-session.
