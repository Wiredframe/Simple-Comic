//
//  SCLibraryStore.swift
//  Simple Comic
//
//  The library index in memory, and the one place that reads and writes library.json.
//
//  Everything here is main-thread only: the store is small (a few hundred KB even for a
//  large library), views observe it directly, and the expensive work — opening archives,
//  extracting covers, copying bytes — happens elsewhere and hands finished values back.
//  Writes are debounced and atomic, so a burst of updates during a scan costs one write.
