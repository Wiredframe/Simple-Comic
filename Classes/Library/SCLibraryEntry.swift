//
//  SCLibraryEntry.swift
//  Simple Comic
//
//  The library's value types: one entry per comic, one folder per scanned source, and
//  the document that holds both and is written to library.json.
//
//  Deliberately plain Codable structs rather than managed objects. The app's Core Data
//  store is scratch space for open windows — closing a window deletes its session, and
//  SimpleComicAppDelegate deletes the whole store outright on a version mismatch. The
//  library has to outlive all of that, so it owns its own file.
//
//  Decoding is written by hand with `decodeIfPresent` throughout: a field added in a
//  later version must never make an older index unreadable, and one unknown comic must
//  never cost the user their whole library.
