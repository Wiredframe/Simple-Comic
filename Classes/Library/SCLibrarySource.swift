//
//  SCLibrarySource.swift
//  Simple Comic
//
//  A scanned comic folder: the app is sandboxed, so reaching a folder the user picked
//  means holding a security-scoped grant, and remembering it across launches means a
//  security-scoped bookmark.
//
//  The same round trip already exists on TSSTManagedGroup (setFileURL:/fileURL), but that
//  one is destructive by design: when a bookmark won't resolve it puts up a modal panel and
//  deletes the managed object. A scan runs over a whole folder, unattended, so this version
//  only ever reports failure and leaves the decision to the caller.
//
//  All the resolving and enumerating here can block on a network volume. Call it off the
//  main thread.
