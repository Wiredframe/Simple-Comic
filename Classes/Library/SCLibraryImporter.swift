//
//  SCLibraryImporter.swift
//  Simple Comic
//
//  Turns files into library entries, and library entries into readable files.
//
//  The split that matters: `prepare` does the slow part — opening the archive, extracting
//  a cover, parsing metadata — off the main thread and returns a plain value; `commit`
//  takes that value and inserts it into the store on the main thread. Nothing that touches
//  the store ever waits on a disk.
//
//  A scanned comic is never copied. Only its cover and metadata come into the library; the
//  archive itself is fetched on demand when the comic is opened (`ensureLocal`) and can be
//  thrown away again (`evict`) without losing the entry.
//
