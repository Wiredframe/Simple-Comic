//
//  SCCellMouse.swift
//  Simple Comic
//
//  Native mouse handling for one cover in the library grid: select on mouse-down, open on
//  the second click, highlight on hover.
//
//  This is AppKit rather than SwiftUI gestures because SwiftUI cannot express what a Finder
//  icon does. A `.onTapGesture` next to an `.onTapGesture(count: 2)` has to wait out
//  `NSEvent.doubleClickInterval` — half a second — before it can tell the two apart, and that
//  wait is plainly felt. A zero-distance `DragGesture` reports immediately but wins the
//  gesture race, which kills the double click. AppKit has had the answer since the beginning:
//  one `mouseDown:` carrying a `clickCount`. Nothing has to be disambiguated, so nothing has
//  to be waited for.
//
//  Hover rides along in the same view, through a tracking area, which is also what AppKit
//  does natively.
//
