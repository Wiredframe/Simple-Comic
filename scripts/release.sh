# Builds a universal Release build of Simple Comic and packs it for a GitHub release.
#
# The build is ad-hoc signed, which is what an Xcode build without a Developer ID produces and
# what Apple Silicon needs at minimum in order to run an app at all. It is deliberately NOT
# signed with a Developer ID and NOT notarised: that would tie every future release to a paid
# membership, and this project would rather not depend on one. The cost is a Gatekeeper prompt
# on first launch, which the README and the release notes explain.
#
# If that ever changes, the way back is small: add
#   CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: … (TEAM)" CODE_SIGN_STYLE=Manual \
#   DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=TEAM ENABLE_HARDENED_RUNTIME=YES OTHER_CODE_SIGN_FLAGS="--timestamp"
# to the xcodebuild call below, then `xcrun notarytool submit --wait` the zip and
# `xcrun stapler staple` the app before packaging it.
#
# The zip is made with ditto rather than `zip`: it keeps symlinks, resource forks and the code
# signature intact. A plain `zip` produces an archive whose app fails signature validation on
# the other side.
#
# Usage: scripts/release.sh [output-directory]
